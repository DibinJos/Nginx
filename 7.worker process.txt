Number of worker process can be assigned manually 

on top of nginx.conf file

worker_processes 2;

And worker process runs on a seperate CPU core
So it won't be a good option to run 2 worker_processes on a single core processor machines 
as 2 worker process would be running on a 50% utilisation

We can know the number of cores the machines has by command

lscpu


We can also set worker_processes to auto as it would spin up the worker process as per the number of cores

worker_processes auto;

And in events section we can add worker_connections which are the number of connection each worker process can accept
Or in layman terms no. of files which can be opened concurrently

To get the limit use command

ulimit -n
>1024

events{
    worker_connections 1024
}


So max connections would be

worker_processes * worker_connections = max_connections
