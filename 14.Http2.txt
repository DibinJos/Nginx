Adding dynamic module http2

nginx -V

./configure <all module> --with-http_v2_module

make

make install

http2 only works in https so we need to create ssl certificates:

To create ssl certificate as http2 is always https
openssl req -x509 -days 10 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/self.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/self.crt


And add :

listen 443 ssl http2; 
ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/self.crt;    #ssl certificate/keys generated using ssl
ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/self.key; 

To the configuration files
