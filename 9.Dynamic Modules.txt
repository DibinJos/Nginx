Adding dynamic modules to the nginx

Dynamic modules can only be added by rebuilding the Nginx

In the extracted folder we need to configure the nginx

To get all the config properties with which the Nginx was built

nginx -V

If we have to add dynamic module named --with-http_image_filter_module=dynamic
(we can get the list of all by ./configure --help)
(And all dynamic modules end with =dynamic e.g --with-http_image_filter_module=dynamic , so it can filtered by ./configure --help | grep dynamic)

./configure <all the modules as installed previously(copy it from nginx -V)> --with-http_image_filter_module=dynamic --module-path=/etc/nginx/modules

(Install sudo apt-get install libgd-dev for the http image filter package as it's a pre requisite)

sudo systemctl reload nginx
